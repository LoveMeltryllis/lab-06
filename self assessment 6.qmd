## Self-assessment
```{r}
I learned how to use data documentation to understand a resource.

I found that combining the results into a single dataset is challenging,but I understood it through reading the [Recipe #6](https://qtalr.github.io/qtalrkit/articles/recipe-6.html)
                                                                                                                 
I would like to know more about best practices for ensuring data quality, strategies for data augmentation and enrichment, methods for handling bias and fairness issues, and approaches for maintaining the relevance and usefulness of curated datasets over time.

I can find the answer on [Here](https://www.techtarget.com/searchbusinessanalytics/definition/data-curation)
